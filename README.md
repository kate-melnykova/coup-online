## Game of Coup
During quarantine, in-person meetings are discouraged.

Sadly, it includes board games.

As a solution, this repository contains online version
of a the Game of Coup.

This game does not belong to me, and I am not its creator.
The true owner of the game is Rikki Tahta. Please support the game
game developer by buying the original game.
